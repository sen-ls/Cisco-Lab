## 💻 Cisco Networking Labs

This repository serves as a centralized collection of all the **Cisco networking labs** I have completed as part of my studies and self-learning.

---

### **Overview**

This repository contains various network topologies and configurations designed to solidify my understanding of fundamental and advanced Cisco technologies.

The labs utilize the following simulation tools:

* **Cisco Packet Tracer (PT):** Used primarily for foundational labs and smaller network setups.
* **EVE-NG:** Employed for more complex, multi-vendor, and advanced lab scenarios requiring actual Cisco IOS images (e.g., routing protocols, switching, security features).

### **Repository Structure**

Each lab is organized into its own dedicated folder. Inside every lab folder, you will find:

1.  **Topology File:** The saved network topology file for the specific simulator used (e.g., a `.pkt` file for Packet Tracer or an EVE-NG `.zip` export).
2.  **Detailed Lab Documentation:** A comprehensive document (typically a `.md`, `.pdf`, or `.docx` file) that includes:
    * The **scenario description** and objectives.
    * The **initial network diagram** (logical and/or physical view).
    * **Step-by-step instructions** for configuration.
    * **Verification steps** and expected outcomes.
    * Any specific challenges or key takeaways.

### **Getting Started**

To view or replicate the labs:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [Your Repository URL Here]
    ```
2.  **Ensure you have the necessary simulation tools installed:**
    * [Cisco Packet Tracer](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer)
    * [EVE-NG Community Edition](https://www.eve-ng.net/index.php/download/) (and the required Cisco images for EVE-NG).
3.  **Navigate to a lab folder** and open the corresponding topology file with the correct simulator.
